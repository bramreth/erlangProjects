Functional work I have done on my chromebook, this has been my first attempt at a functional and concurrent language; but my practice work is all here.

##The first fall to chrome OS updates messing with my crouton

Sadly the updates have lost alll my files I had set up on my chromebook so now I am setting about learning how to back up chroots and feeling sad I didn upload more of my work.
